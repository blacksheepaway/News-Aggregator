# News Aggregator GUI

Welcome to the News Aggregator GUI project! This application allows users to access top news articles by either category or query with a user-friendly interface. It's perfect for showcasing your skills to potential employers, as it demonstrates your ability to work with APIs, GUIs, and Python.

## How it Works

The News Aggregator GUI uses the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch top headlines from various sources. By entering a category or a query, the user can access a list of articles and click on their links to read more. The GUI is built using `tkinter`, a popular Python library for creating graphical user interfaces.

## Technologies and Techniques

- Python
- `tkinter` for creating the GUI
- NewsAPI for fetching articles
- Web scraping with `requests`
- Hyperlink handling with `webbrowser`

## Example

Using the News Aggregator GUI is simple. Users can enter either a category or a query, and then click the "Get Articles" button. The application will then display a list of articles with clickable links.
